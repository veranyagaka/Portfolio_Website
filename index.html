    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Vera Nyagaka</h2>
    <p>I find immense joy and fulfillment in the world of coding. It's not just a hobby or a skill for me; it's a
        passion that lights up my days. Whether I'm crafting intricate web pages with HTML and JavaScript, or diving
        into the realms of mobile app development with Flutter and Python, each moment spent immersed in code feels like
        an adventure waiting to unfold. As a student at Strathmore University, located in the vibrant city of Nairobi,
        I'm surrounded by endless opportunities to expand my knowledge and hone my skills. Beyond coding, I also relish
        engaging in fun activities that stimulate my mind and nourish my soul. Whether it's exploring new books, solving
        puzzles, or simply spending quality time with friends, I believe in living life to the fullest and embracing
        every opportunity for growth and enjoyment.</p>
