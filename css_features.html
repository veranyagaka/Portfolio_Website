    <h1>INTRODUCTION SECTION</h1>
    <P>Hello! I'm Nyagaka Vera Moraa, a passionate Computer Science student at Strathmore University. I have a deep love
        for exploring the realms of technology and learning about its endless possibilities. Beyond the realm of coding
        and algorithms, I find solace in the world of literature, indulging in the enchanting realms crafted by words.
        Whether it's delving into the intricacies of a programming language or immersing myself in the pages of a
        captivating novel, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and embrace new experiences. As an avid reader and
        aspiring technologist, I strive to blend creativity with logic, seeking innovative solutions to real-world
        problems while enjoying the journey of self-discovery along the way.</P>
